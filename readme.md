# Open Graph for 1C-Bitrix

Open Graph is a standard developed by the social network Facebook. It allows you to control the preview that is generated when you publish a link to a site on social networks, and transfer information to other Internet services. This micro-markup is also used when generating link previews in instant messengers (Viber, Telegram and others).

Tags output by the module:
- og:title
- og:image
- og:image:width
- og:image:height
- og:url
- og:type
- og:description
- og:site_name
- og:locale

The module works on the basis of highload blocks, the selection is cached and does not load your site.

The module does not require integration; after installation, you can immediately proceed to creating rules for displaying og tags on the site.

## Installation
You can install it by default 1C-BItrix methods from marketplace [here](https://marketplace.1c-bitrix.ru/solutions/imyie.og/)
